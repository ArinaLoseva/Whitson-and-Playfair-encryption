# Whitson-and-Playfair-encryption
code for Windows Form application for text encryption using Whitson + Playfair methods

## About
Programming language: C#  

Probably someone will also create a lab to protect computer information...

## Task conditions
:white_check_mark: Develop a windowed software tool for encrypting and decrypting data using the Whitson double square cipher, where the Playfair cipher is used to obtain the Whitson cipher key.  

:white_check_mark: The program provides two modes: encryption and decryption. The encrypted message is displayed on the screen and saved to a text file.
For decryption, the ciphertext is loaded from the file.  

:white_check_mark: The Playfair cipher is used to obtain the key for the Whitson cipher. The fields contain the key for the Playfair cipher and the message that will serve as the future key for the Whitson cipher (after encryption using the Playfair cipher).  

:white_check_mark: Provide for the possibility of generating a second key, since the Whitson cipher includes two alphabets.
Based on the transformed key, new matrix-alphabets are constructed
Whitson cipher and displayed on the screen. Please note that two different alphabets are being built.
